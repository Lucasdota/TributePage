            <h2>Here's a time line of Nikola Tesla's life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">1856</span> - Born in Smiljan, Croatia
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">1870</span> - Studied engineering and physics without graduating
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">1882</span> - Went to work in Paris for the Continental Edison Company, 
                    and, while on assignment to Strassburg in 1883, he constructed, after work hours, his first 
                    induction motor
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">1884</span> - Immigrated to the United States and sold the patent 
                    rights to his system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors to George Westinghouse
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">1891</span> - Invented the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">1898</span> - Announced his invention of a teleautomatic boat guided by remote control. 
                    When skepticism was voiced, Tesla proved his claims for it before a crowd in Madison Square Garden
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">1900</span> - Made what he regarded as his most important discovery, terrestrial stationary waves. 
                    By this discovery he proved that Earth could be used as a conductor and made to resonate at a certain electrical 
                    frequency
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">1900</span> - Began construction on Long Island of a wireless world broadcasting tower, with $150,000 
                    capital from the American financier J. Pierpont Morgan. Tesla claimed he secured the loan by assigning 51 percent of 
                    his patent rights of telephony and telegraphy to Morgan. He expected to provide worldwide communication and to furnish 
                    facilities for sending pictures, messages, weather warnings, and stock reports. The project was abandoned because of a 
                    financial panic, labour troubles, and Morgan’s withdrawal of support. It was Tesla’s greatest defeat
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">1915</span> - Was severely disappointed when a report that he and Edison were to share the Nobel Prize 
                    proved erroneous
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">1917</span> - Was the recipient of the Edison Medal in 1917, the highest honour that the American 
                    Institute of Electrical Engineers could bestow
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="bold">1943</span> - Died at the age of 87 in New York, United States
                </li>
